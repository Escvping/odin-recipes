    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These homemade, gluten-free noodles are made with potato starch. Similar in texture to a pad Thai noodle (slippery <br>and sticky on the outside and firm and chewy on the inside), they're neutral in taste and are perfect for absorbing the <br>flavor of any sauce.</p>
    <ul><h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <li>1 cup potato starch, or as needed</li>
        <li>Â¼ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <ol><h2>Steps</h2>
        <li><h3>Step 1</h3>
            Combine 1 cup potato starch, salt, and vegetable oil in a bowl. Add a splash of boiling water at a time, stirring between additions, until you get a perfectly textured dough.        </li>
        <li><h3>Step 2</h3>
            Transfer to a work surface dusted with a little potato starch. Working quickly while the dough is still warm, knead, adding more potato starch if necessary, until smooth and elastic.
        </li>
        <li><h3>Step 3</h3>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Set out a large bowl of cold water.
        </li>
