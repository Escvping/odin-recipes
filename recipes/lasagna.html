    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>One day, not having any gluten-free pasta on hand but lots of zucchini, I decided to use 'zoodles' instead of noodles. <br>
    The whole family enjoyed it! I don't use any salt in the recipe because the cheeses already contain it. <br>
    This dish is even better the next day and freezes well too.</p>
    <ul><h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <li>4 zucchini</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups homemade or store-bought tomato sauce</li>
        <li>⅔ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups bechamel sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh basil, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <ol><h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol><h3>Step 1</h3>
            Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
        </ol>
        <ol><h3>Step 2</h3>
            Cut zucchini lengthwise into 1/4-inch thick slices with a knife or <br> mandolin.
        </ol>
        <ol><h3>Step 3</h3>
            Pour 2 tablespoons tomato sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking <br> dish. Arrange zucchini slices in a single layer, slightly overlapping, over <br> tomato sauce.
        </ol>   
        <ol><h3>Step 4</h3>
            Top with a thin layer of mozzarella, 1/3 of the bechamel (see Editor's <br>Note), 1/3 of remaining tomato sauce, 1/3 of the Parmigiano Reggiano <br>cheese, and 1/3 of the basil. Repeat layers, topping with bechamel <br>and Parmigiano Reggiano cheese.
        </ol>
        <ol><h3>Step 5</h3>
            Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly and the top is golden <br>brown, about 35 minutes. Allow to set until remaining liquid is <br>absorbed, about 10 minutes.
        </ol>
